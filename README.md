# Discord-Bot
A Discord C#/.NET Bot 

![Example Image](/img/Discord_Bot_Example.png)

This Discord bot is a chat and voice bot coded in C# with [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)

This bot is built to be run on any .NET Framework compatible machine. 
It is meant for single server usage due to the heavy amount of resources the voice part consumes.

_This bot currently is still in development, further changes to come._
